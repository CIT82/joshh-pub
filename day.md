- I am a service desk analyst so I take calls from nurses and doctors and fix issues with their computers and printers and other things as well

2. Then as soon as I am done with work I go into Dad mode helping my wife take care of my 1 year old and 10 year old
- I usually feed the baby some breakfast, then diper change then play time till its nap time
- While he is napping I will catchup on school work and get some assignments down

## *Afternoon*

1. Usually my wife will pick our son up from school and then its baby and dad time ususally we both be napping but if he goes with my wife to pick up brother then I usually eat lunch and get ready to go to sleep
